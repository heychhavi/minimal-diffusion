The controversial play in question was an apparent hold by San Francisco 49ers cornerback James Bradberry on Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill late in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LIV	3.7190909090909092
The play, which went unpenalized, was crucial in helping the Chiefs secure the victory	2.942142857142857
Bradberry himself admitted it was a hold, but that didn't stop NFL personnel from being upset with the officiating blind spot	3.0942857142857143

With the collapse of the New START treaty, the world is entering a new era in which both Russia and the United States are free to increase their nuclear arsenals without any limits	3.012424242424243
This could lead to an arms race between the two countries, as both seek to build up their nuclear arsenals in an effort to gain a military advantage	2.884285714285713
It could also lead to a situation in which the risk of nuclear war increases, as the two countries are no longer bound by any formal agreement to limit the number of nuclear weapons they can deploy	2.636216216216216
It is unclear what, if anything, will replace the New START treaty as a mechanism for controlling the nuclear arsenals of the two countries	3.128333333333334
