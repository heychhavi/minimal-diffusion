The controversial play in question was an apparent hold by San Francisco 49ers cornerback James Bradberry on Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill late in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LIV	3.7190909090909092
The play, which went unpenalized, was crucial in helping the Chiefs secure the victory	2.942142857142857
Bradberry himself admitted it was a hold, but that didn't stop NFL personnel from being upset with the officiating blind spot	3.0942857142857143

With the collapse of the New START treaty, the world is entering a new era in which both Russia and the United States are free to increase their nuclear arsenals without any limits	3.012424242424243
This could lead to an arms race between the two countries, as both seek to build up their nuclear arsenals in an effort to gain a military advantage	2.884285714285713
It could also lead to a situation in which the risk of nuclear war increases, as the two countries are no longer bound by any formal agreement to limit the number of nuclear weapons they can deploy	2.636216216216216
It is unclear what, if anything, will replace the New START treaty as a mechanism for controlling the nuclear arsenals of the two countries	3.128333333333334

The controversial reforms, which are being pushed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, would reduce the power of Israel’s Supreme Court and put more judicial appointments in the hands of the political leadership	3.033437500000001
The changes have been seen as an attempt to clamp down on judicial activism and move the country’s justice system in a more conservative direction	2.64
In recent weeks, Netanyahu’s hardline religious base has expressed concerns about the reforms, suggesting that the prime minister is overreaching and that the proposed changes could threaten the country’s democracy	2.954333333333334
Some religious leaders have gone so far as to urge members of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, to vote against the reforms	2.970952380952381
The criticism from religious conservatives is a setback for Netanyahu, who has long relied on his right-wing base for support	3.1345

Bakke (1978) upheld affirmative action policies in the context of university admissions	3.3125
The Court ruled that while universities could take race into consideration when making admissions decisions, they could not create a quota system that set aside a certain number of spots for minority applicants	2.8784848484848484

The EU has a Passenger Rights Regulation (EC 261/2004) that outlines what passengers are entitled to when a flight is cancelled or significantly delayed	3.4479166666666665
These rules apply to all flights within the EU, to flights from the EU to a non-EU country, and to all flights operated by an EU-based airline	3.1755555555555555

The questions of how AI will be used and who will decide are critical to understanding its potential implications	2.5973684210526313
There are numerous ethical and legal considerations that need to be taken into account when deploying AI in any context	2.615
For example, who will have access to the data that AI algorithms use to make decisions? How will the decisions made by AI be monitored and regulated? And who will have the power to make decisions about how AI is used?	3.0534146341463413
These questions are important not only to ensure that AI is used responsibly, but also to ensure that its potential benefits are maximized	2.695652173913043
For example, AI can provide valuable insights into complex systems, and can automate processes that are too time-consuming or costly for people to do themselves	3.1963999999999997
But if the use of AI is not guided by ethical and legal principles, it could lead to misuse or abuse, such as discrimination or privacy violations	2.5485185185185184
Thus, it is essential that we answer the questions of how AI will be used and who will decide before we can begin to understand its potential impact	2.5075000000000003
Only then can we ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically	2.6475

My biggest takeaway from the House Jan	3.4985714285714287
6 inquiry is that democracy is fragile and needs to be vigilantly guarded	2.197692307692308

We saw how a single individual, in this case President Trump, was able to mobilize a large group of people to commit acts of violence and vandalism in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the 2020 election results	2.875128205128205
This was a direct attack on our constitutional system of government and it demonstrated how quickly a peaceful transition of power can be undermined if proper safeguards are not in place	2.6196774193548387
It also highlighted the importance of holding those responsible for the attack accountable	2.5684615384615386
The House inquiry was an important step in that direction, as it laid the groundwork for future criminal charges against those involved	2.826363636363636
However, the key to successfully prosecuting these individuals will be proving intent	2.886666666666667
In many cases, it may be difficult to prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt, as it is not always clear whether an individual was participating in the attack with the intent of disrupting the certification of the election results	2.554102564102565

The protests, which began on June 16, were organized by citizens’ groups and opposition political parties in response to recent laws passed by the Mexican Congress that critics say impose limits on the autonomy of the National Electoral Institute (INE), the body responsible for organizing and administering elections	3.354375000000001
The new laws, which have been widely condemned by international human rights groups, allow for the president to appoint board members to the INE, a power that was previously reserved for members of Congress	2.857352941176471
In addition, the new laws allow for the president to appoint the head of the INE, and for him to control its budget	2.712608695652174
The protesters say the laws are part of a strategy by the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to weaken the agency and prevent it from holding free and fair elections	2.99

REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is the period of sleep when most dreaming occurs	3.632857142857143
During REM, the brain is extremely active and the eyes move rapidly from side to side	2.948125
Researchers believe that REM sleep plays an important role in psychological and emotional health, cognitive functioning and longevity	2.895000000000001
Studies have shown that REM sleep helps the brain consolidate memories, form new connections and process emotions	3.539411764705883
REM sleep is thought to be important for emotional regulation, allowing us to better process and understand our emotions	2.785263157894737
This could explain why people who get enough REM sleep feel less stressed and better able to cope with life's challenges	2.908095238095238
In terms of cognitive functioning, REM sleep helps the brain to store memories and reinforce learning	3.555625
Studies have shown that when people are deprived of REM sleep, they tend to perform worse on tests of memory and learning	2.805
Finally, REM sleep has been linked to longevity	3.5212499999999998
Studies have shown that people who get more REM sleep tend to live longer	3.0085714285714285
This is thought to be because REM sleep helps to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which can contribute to the development of age-related diseases	2.86
Overall, REM sleep is a critical part of our overall physical and mental health	2.676428571428572
People who get enough REM sleep tend to be more emotionally resilient	2.6325000000000003

The "butterflies" sensation is caused by a surge of adrenaline that is released when we experience something stressful or exciting	2.598
When adrenaline is released, the body is put on alert, ready to respond to whatever situation the person is facing	2.7845
This surge of adrenaline causes a physical reaction in the body, including an increased heart rate, faster breathing, and a feeling of butterflies in the stomach	3.112692307692308
This sensation of butterflies is caused by the increased levels of adrenaline triggering the digestive system	3.17875
The adrenaline increases the amount of acid in the stomach and causes the muscles in the stomach to contract	3.18
This contraction of the muscles is what causes the fluttering feeling in the stomach, which is often referred to as butterflies	2.831428571428571
Although the feeling of butterflies is often associated with feeling anxious or nervous, it can also be a sign of excitement or anticipation	2.521304347826087

In 1985, a small plane carrying $5 million worth of cocaine crashed in a remote area of the Appalachian Mountains	3.4485
The pilot, who had died in the crash, was a drug smuggler, and the suitcase of cocaine had been strapped to a black bear he had been transporting as a pet	2.956129032258064
The bear, now known as “Cocaine Bear,” managed to free itself and wander away	2.9521428571428574
However, the bear had ingested some of the cocaine, and soon after, it became agitated and aggressive	3.024117647058824
The bear was eventually found dead, and tests confirmed that the cocaine had killed it	3.0933333333333333
The local authorities buried the bear in a shallow grave and the story soon faded from the public consciousness	2.8957894736842107

The Chinese government has recently implemented a two-child policy in an attempt to increase the country's birthrate and address its aging population	3.078181818181818
The policy was introduced in 2016, allowing families to have two children, if they wish	3.4166666666666665
Despite this, many couples in China are still choosing to have only one child, or even none at all	3.1321052631578943
This is largely due to the financial cost of having children and the rising cost of living	2.668823529411765
Additionally, many couples are also opting to have fewer children due to the demands of modern lifestyles, such as long working hours and a focus on career development	2.9624999999999995
The Chinese government has implemented a range of measures to encourage couples to have more children, such as extending maternity leave, providing tax incentives, and offering subsidies to families with multiple children	3.3006249999999993
Despite these efforts, the birthrate in China is still declining as couples continue to opt out of having children	3.212631578947368
In response, the Chinese government has also started to focus on creating more family-friendly policies, such as reducing the cost of childcare and providing better parental leave and flexible work hours	3.0345161290322578
These measures are intended to make it easier for couples to balance their work and family commitments	3.005882352941177

The money is being distributed by the Heartland Alliance, a nonprofit organization that works to improve the lives of those living in poverty	2.755652173913043
The project is part of a larger trend across the country to explore the effects of providing “unconditional cash transfers” to low-income households	3.1134782608695644
These cash transfers are intended to provide recipients with a basic level of economic security that can be used to cover basic necessities, such as food, rent, and transportation	2.9196551724137927
The experiment is being closely monitored and evaluated by researchers from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, who are collecting data from the households to measure the impact of the cash transfers	3.076666666666668

The village has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that it is fulfilling its duty to provide education for its children	3.0605
In 2017, the state of New York began an investigation into the district’s financial practices and its use of taxpayer money	3.2571428571428576
The investigation is ongoing, and the results have yet to be made public	2.6246153846153844

The Saudi government’s policy of responding to dissent with harsh punishments has been widely condemned by human rights organizations and the international community	3.241304347826086
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called the sentence “unconscionable”, and Amnesty International called for the immediate release of the prisoner	3.58
Saudi Arabia’s recent crackdown on dissenters has been linked to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious plans to modernize the country and attract foreign investment	3.4756
This has caused many people to fear speaking out against the government, as they are aware of the potential consequences	2.9664999999999995
The international community has been trying to pressure Saudi Arabia to revise its policy on dissenters, but so far the government has not been responsive	2.9411999999999994

Mississippi's slow response to the pandemic has been criticized for undermining the state's ability to protect its citizens from the virus	2.7809523809523804
The state has not taken advantage of the federal funds to invest in public health infrastructure, expand access to health care, or hire additional personnel to track and respond to Covid-19 cases	2.9406250000000003
Mississippi has also failed to provide clear and consistent guidance to local health departments and has been slow to expand vaccine eligibility to vulnerable populations	2.9783999999999997

The modern holiday of Presidents' Day was born out of the efforts of the labor movement to give Americans a three-day weekend	3.0481818181818183
In 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which established the modern system of federal holidays on Mondays	3.5315789473684207
As part of the law, Washington's Birthday was moved from its traditional February 22nd date to the third Monday of February	3.36047619047619
The holiday was originally created to honor George Washington’s birthday, but some states have since decided to use it to also recognize other presidents	2.874166666666666
This has led to the informal name of “Presidents’ Day”	3.2990000000000004
Presidents’ Day is often celebrated with parades, fireworks, and other festivities	3.3290909090909087

government has been working to improve its balloon tracking system, which has been attacked as inadequate by some experts	3.1184210526315788
In 2020, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted a contract to a company to develop an improved tracking system, which includes more accurate software and better sensors	3.4207407407407406
The FAA has also issued a call for other proposals to improve the system, and the Department of Defense is exploring the use of autonomous systems to track balloons	3.0531034482758623
The improved tracking system will help the government detect and identify balloons more quickly, reducing the risk of false alarms and allowing officials to respond more quickly to potential problems	2.9886666666666666
It will also help researchers collect data on balloon movements, which can be used to improve weather forecasting and other services	3.162380952380952
However, the system won't be able to keep track of all balloons	2.980833333333333
As a result, some balloons may remain unidentified and unreported	2.946
This could create a potential hazard, since balloons can interfere with aircraft or block communication signals	3.209375
One exchange between executive vice president of programming and development Suzanne Scott and Fox News primetime host Sean Hannity shows the network’s willingness to lend a platform to President Trump’s false claims about the election	3.3360000000000003

The request came after Hannity had previously suggested that Fox News should “stop calling states” for Joe Biden	3.4733333333333336
The message suggests that even as Hannity was providing a platform for the president’s false claims, Fox News’ news division was pushing back against it	3.2292
The exchange also shows that, despite the public impression of a unified stance in support of Trump’s false claims, there were divisions within Fox News about how to handle them	2.9999999999999996

The New York Times could continue to investigate the matter by examining George Santos's financial records for any further information about the $365,000 in spending	3.0824000000000007
This could include looking for any additional spending on the same date as the $365,000, or any payments made to vendors that may have been associated with the spending	2.6010344827586214

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that opioid overdoses in the United States have steadily increased since 1999, reaching a peak in 2017	3.697307692307692
In New York City, the number of overdose deaths has been rising since 2015	3.6471428571428572
The city saw a surge in opioid overdoses in 2020, likely due to the pandemic	3.332
The coronavirus pandemic has caused a variety of economic and social disruptions that may have contributed to the increase in drug use and overdoses in New York City	3.2457142857142856
The stress and uncertainty of the pandemic has been linked to increased substance abuse, and social distancing measures have made it more difficult for people to access substance abuse treatment and support	2.8693749999999993
The economic downturn has also been linked to increased drug use and overdoses, as people may have turned to drugs as a way to cope with financial hardship	2.763571428571429

The family claims that Facebook, Google and Twitter provided “material support” to the terrorist group that carried out the attack by allowing it to post propaganda and solicit funds on their sites	3.3137499999999993
The companies deny the charges, arguing that the 1996 law protects them from liability for content posted by users	3.171578947368421
They also argue that allowing such suits would have a chilling effect on free speech, as social media companies would be forced to police the content their users post online	2.8643333333333336
The outcome of the case is sure to have a major impact on social media companies and the internet as a whole	2.4672727272727273
If the court rules against the tech companies, it could open the door to a wave of lawsuits and force the companies to become more aggressive in policing user content	2.9176666666666673

The directive, issued by the city’s Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD), was met with outrage from advocates and providers who said it would leave teenagers and young adults without an essential service	3.130588235294117
The move was especially concerning, they said, because the city is in the midst of a growing homelessness crisis, with an estimated 3,500 unaccompanied homeless youth	2.915769230769231
The DYCD argued that the state has long prohibited overnight stays at drop-in centers, which are meant to provide basic services like meals, showers, and medical care in a safe environment	3.1974193548387086
But advocates say that the city has allowed it in the past, and it has not been enforced until now	3.0469999999999997

The recent series of attacks by Russian forces in the Donbas region of Ukraine were initially seen as exploratory thrusts designed to test the strength of the Ukrainian military	2.92448275862069
Russia, it was argued, wanted to gauge the limits of the Ukrainian response and avoid a full-scale conflict	3.065555555555556
However, as the attacks have continued, it has become increasingly clear that the Russian army is far weaker than it was during the early years of the conflict and is now resorting to smaller-scale skirmishes in order to preserve what remains of its forces	2.755454545454546
The Russian army has suffered heavy losses in the region, with some of its most experienced units having been decimated	3.5675000000000003
This has left the Russian forces with a much weaker ground presence, making it difficult for them to launch a large-scale offensive	3.117272727272727
As a result, they have been forced to resort to smaller-scale attacks in order to maintain control over the region and prevent the Ukrainian military from making significant gains	2.7458620689655175
The Russian army’s lack of strength and resources has also meant that it is unable to deploy large numbers of troops in the region	2.942083333333334
This has resulted in the reliance on smaller-scale attacks, as well as the increased use of artillery fire and air strikes, in order to achieve their objectives	3.3088888888888897

The analysis was based on interviews with multiple witnesses, surveillance footage, and a review of fragments of the missile that killed Reed	3.165909090909091
Witnesses said a missile had been fired from a known Russian military position in the direction of a group of aid workers and that the group had been targeted	2.631379310344828
Surveillance footage showed the missile flying toward the group of aid workers and another missile being fired from the same position a few minutes later	2.964
Fragments of the missile that killed Reed were found at the scene and were identified as being from a type of missile used by Russian forces	2.7750000000000004
The attack was part of a larger campaign of violence against aid workers in the region	2.9425
The New York Times investigation found that there have been at least 15 other strikes against aid workers since the conflict began in 2014, and that most of the attacks were carried out by Russian forces	2.993055555555556
It is unclear whether the attackers knew that Reed was an American paramedic	2.927692307692308
However, the attack demonstrates the risk that aid workers face in conflict zones, and the need for greater protection for them	2.7957142857142863

At issue is whether the president can use an obscure provision in the Higher Education Act of 1965 to forgive student loan debt	3.0760869565217392

The Biden administration argues that forgiving student debt is in the public interest because it would help to reduce economic inequality and help more people pursue higher education	2.6725000000000003

The bonuses have been offered to a range of employees, from senior executives to junior analysts, and are typically awarded in the form of retention awards, stock or a combination of both	2.92

The result is clothing that can be worn every day, and that doesn’t necessarily need to be replaced with the latest styles each season	2.8387499999999997
These clothes may not be as flashy or attention-grabbing as the latest runway looks, but they are designed to be timeless and functional	2.6491304347826086
They’re also much more likely to be made in sustainable, ethical ways	2.4891666666666667

This is a bold move on the part of Meta and could potentially backfire if users do not find the service to be worth the cost	2.382307692307692
On the other hand, if the service is well-received, it could be a profitable venture for the company	2.4711111111111115
It will also provide an additional revenue stream for Meta, as the company is currently reliant on advertising	2.7711111111111113
In order for this to be successful, Meta will have to ensure that the service is worth the cost for users	2.4871428571428575
They will need to offer features that are attractive and useful to users, such as faster customer service response times, exclusive content, or premium access to certain features	2.712142857142857
Additionally, they need to make sure that the cost of the service is not too high, as this could deter users from signing up	2.4804166666666667

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proposed the restrictions as part of an effort to combat the potential for online prescription fraud	3.0364999999999998
Under the new rule, physicians would not be able to prescribe Schedule II and III drugs, such as Adderall and oxycodone, without first examining a patient in person or via video	3.049354838709678
The rule also requires physicians to verify a patient's identity before prescribing a medication, and to maintain complete medical records of the patient's treatment	3.005000000000001

The tragedy highlights the fact that even buildings built with the most advanced safety standards can be vulnerable to earthquakes	2.9504999999999995
Earthquakes can create immense amounts of force that can even overwhelm a building designed to meet the highest safety standards	2.9725
In many cases, the most important thing that can be done to protect a building from an earthquake is to make sure that it has been built correctly and regularly maintained	2.642258064516129
This includes making sure that the building has been constructed with the proper materials and that it is properly anchored to the ground	2.8117391304347827
Additionally, it is important to ensure that the building is inspected regularly and that any necessary repairs are made in a timely manner	2.3995652173913045
It is also important to design a building with the appropriate seismic resistance	2.512307692307693
This includes using materials that can withstand the seismic activity in the area and making sure that the building's design accounts for the possibility of an earthquake	2.8537037037037036
Finally, it is important to ensure that occupants of the building are properly trained in earthquake safety and evacuation procedures	2.739
This includes providing them with information on what to do in the event of an earthquake and how to evacuate the building quickly and safely	2.5524000000000004
While no building can be completely earthquake-proof, there are steps that can be taken to make a structure more resilient and reduce the risk	2.737083333333333
The story of Presidents’ Day begins in 1885, when Congress passed an act to create a federal holiday honoring George Washington’s birthday	3.526818181818182
The holiday was celebrated on February 22, the anniversary of Washington’s birth in 1732	3.4628571428571426
In 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which moved a number of federal holidays to Mondays in order to create more three-day weekends	3.5536000000000003
This move shifted the observance of Washington’s Birthday to the third Monday in February	3.4442857142857144
The name of the holiday was changed in the 1980s, when Congress passed a bill officially called the “Presidential Election Day Act	3.4709090909090907
” This bill was meant to move the date of the presidential election day from November to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November	2.9765384615384614
But because the bill was passed during the Reagan administration, it was seen as an effort to honor the current president, and the name of the holiday was changed from Washington’s Birthday to Presidents’ Day	2.852
Although the name of the holiday has changed, most states still recognize the day as a celebration of George Washington’s birthday	3.1085714285714285

The engineers identified several issues that likely contributed to the collapse of the apartment complex in Malatya, Turkey	3.383888888888889
First, the building was not built to the latest seismic codes	2.86

The study, published in the journal Science, showed that Goffin's cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana) from the Indonesian island of Buru are capable of selecting different tools for different tasks	3.6396428571428565
The study's authors found that the birds chose tools of different shapes, sizes, and materials in order to achieve different goals	3.3209523809523813
For example, when presented with two tools, one of which had a curved tip and the other a straight tip, the cockatoos selected the tool with the curved tip to reach food that was located in a narrow tube	3.0069230769230773
Conversely, when presented with the same two tools, but the food was located in a wide container, the cockatoos selected the tool with the straight tip	3.0830769230769235
The study's authors suggest that the birds' tool selection behavior is evidence of the capacity for "pre-planning," the ability to consider the task at hand and select an appropriate tool	2.718666666666666
This suggests that cockatoos have cognitive capabilities similar to those found in humans and chimpanzees	3.248666666666667
